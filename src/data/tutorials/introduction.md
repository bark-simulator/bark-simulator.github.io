## BARK - Behavior benchmARK

In this section, we explain how to clone BARK up to running the first example in BARK.
<br />
<br />
BARK is a semantic simulation framework for autonomous agents with a special focus on autonomous driving. Its behavior model-centric design allows for the rapid development, training and benchmarking of various decision-making algorithms. Due to its fast, semantic runtime, it is especially suited for computationally expensive tasks, such as reinforcement learning.
