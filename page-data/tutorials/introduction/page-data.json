Its behavior model-centric design allows for the rapid development, training and benchmarking of various decision-making algorithms. Due to its fast, semantic runtime, it is especially suited for computationally expensive tasks, such as reinforcement learning.\n<br />\n<br /></p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pJuvZkHkdu0?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"lazy\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tutorials/introduction/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1503014085","3885506533","4018511916","63159454"]}
