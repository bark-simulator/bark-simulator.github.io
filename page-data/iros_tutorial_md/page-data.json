Especially in scenarios involving multiple traffic participants that interact densely, autonomous vehicles still struggle to interpret situations and to eventually achieve their own driving goal. BARK is a semantic simulation framework for autonomous agents with a special focus on autonomous driving. Its behavior model-centric design allows for the rapid development, training and benchmarking of various decision-making algorithms.</p>\n<p>In BARK, behavior models are (re-)used for planning, prediction, and simulation. A range of models is currently available, ranging from simplistic car-following to rule-based intersection crossing models and models derived from the planning community such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Reinforcement Learning-based behavior models.</p>\n<p>In addition to that BARK provides an easy to use benchmarking process to compare various behavior models based on using BARK's data-based or sampling-based scenario generation. BARK supports replay of the <a href=\"https://interaction-dataset.com/\" class=\"text-blue-600\">Interaction Dataset</a> with the possibility to (partially) exchange recorded behavior with interactive models. Coverage-based sampling criteria are supported not only over physical scenario properties such as velocity and vehicle distance ranges, but also over hidden behavior model parameters.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/3e096/bark_screenshot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAIAAAA7N+mxAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAA60lEQVQoz42ROQvCQBCF89OtrC0sbQStRC20Emw8UmjExsqjECwM2HjtORN92YWguIqPIbDLfLMvb6LHh5hZORljHj8VBW+V0lIqVJZlwQbcE3EYNsYKqe5CkiXnJXthSGsDXxgdhq3NO9CKr6c84+14hWFy76zWh+5gidNosW/150zwIj2D0lpba8Mw/nmc7OrdWXpMy7V4mmyYqGCKIKL3kGGS28NtqdLDG0bJZmdSbcQuBcMf4UVgMMz5yV1hdno63+5CCHm+XBGpzym8KjDoc1S+HiGUdcJQz/A3FDAYJAkehQ1xsZY/9ARdX0bL67r0PAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"BARK Simulator\"\n        title=\"BARK Simulator\"\n        src=\"/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/5a190/bark_screenshot.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/772e8/bark_screenshot.png 200w,\n/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/e17e5/bark_screenshot.png 400w,\n/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/5a190/bark_screenshot.png 800w,\n/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/c1b63/bark_screenshot.png 1200w,\n/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/29007/bark_screenshot.png 1600w,\n/static/40ef69ae525c128d935388b6ac4fc58a/3e096/bark_screenshot.png 1718w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Benchmarking Interactive Behavior Planning for Self-Driving Vehicles using BARK"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/iros_tutorial_md/"}}}
